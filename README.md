# ExplodingHoomons

ExplodingHoomons ia a game on the platform "Roblox". It is a Multiplayer game, where players help one another while dodging enemies to get through the obstacle course with increasing difficulty until they reach the "sun".

While this game looks very simple to program. It was very difficult due to the platform I was using to create the game on, as their physics engine
was not the fastest, so I had to find ways to optimize the code in order to ensure the game does not lag.

Here are some of the programming challenges I faced(am in the process of documenting it further)

1. Making many balls move stimultaneously without lag(Attached a ball onto a ray-trace)
2. Detecting collision with player and ball
3. Constantly spawning enemies without lag(by spawning enemies in a far away distance in the beginning of the game, then moving them closer when needed)
