# ExplodingHoomons

While this game looks very simple. It was very difficult due to the platform I was using to create the game on, as their physics engine
was not the fastest.

Here are some of the programming challenges I faced

1. Making many balls move stimultaneously without lag(Attached a ball onto a ray-trace)
2. Detecting collision with player and ball
